# Pre-work - *TipsApp*

**TipsApp** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Akrm Almsaodi**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **2** functionality is complete:

*[] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
*[] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
*[] UI animations
*[] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts
*[] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
*[] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- The ability to dynamically split the bill between multiple payers
- Rounding up/down the share to easily pay the bill
- The option to include/exclude the sales tax in calculating the tip
- The ability to change the 3 default tip percentages in settings
- The ability to change the maximum default number of payers
- External resource to learn more about the appropriate tip percentage

## Notes

Getting familiar with Xcode, storyboard and swift went all very smooth. The main challenge for me was learning the needed swift libraries and all the changes between the versions; however Xcode made it easier for me to figure out most of the issues.
